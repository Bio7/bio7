# This file contains the commands, arguments and flags for the
# ImageJ Macro 'FilterTester'.
#
# Version 2012-Dec-23 for ImageJ 1.47g
#
# The lines contain (semicolon-delimited):
#    command-string; options-string; flags; results
# The strings should not be enclosed in quotes; command-string must not contain
#   additional whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.)
# Flags are bitwise OR of bits:
#   bit 0 (1)  - do on 8-bit image
#   bit 1 (2)  - do on 16-bit image
#   bit 2 (4)  - do on 32-bit image
#   bit 3 (8)  - do on RGB image
#   bit 4 (16) - do on binary image
#   bit 5 (32) - do on stacks of the types defined previously
#   bit 6 (64) - command creates a separate output image (no stack) that should be measured
#   bit 7 (128) - disable anisotropy tests (if filtering is not isotropic, but works differently
#                when rotated/flipped, e.g. "Shadow" filters).
#   bit 8 (256) - disable Undo test
#
# The results are comma-delimited; mean, min, max for each type of selection and data file type
# With the FilterTester in learning mode (with writeResults = true), the results of the
# tests are written (or overwritten) as further arguments in each line.
#
# Lines starting with a character less than '0' (e.g., '#', "!") are comments.
