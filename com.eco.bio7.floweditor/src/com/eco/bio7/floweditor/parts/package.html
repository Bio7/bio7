Implementation of the Controller.
<p>In GEF EditParts play the role of the Controllers.</p>
<p>
Each model element shown in the editor has a corresponding EditPart.
An EditPart maps a model element to a graphical representation (<tt>IFigure</tt> from 
Draw2D) and provides a number of edit policies, that determine how this model element
can be modified.
</p>
<p>
The Shapes-Example uses three kinds of EditParts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Subclasses of <tt>AbstractGraphicalEditPart</tt> for regular model elements
(EllipticalShape, RectangularShape, ShapesDiagram).</li>
<li>A subclass of <tt>AbstractConnectionEditPart</tt> for the Connection model element.</li>
<li>Subclasses of <tt>AbstractTreeEditPart</tt> for the EditParts used in the outline view.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Subclasses of <tt>EditPartFactory</tt> are responsible for mapping model elements to 
EditParts.
</p>
<h2><b>How are new model elements created?</b></h2>
<p>
To create a new model elements several classes of your application work together:
<ol>
<li>
Uppon a mouse-click, the selected tool in the palette 
(see <tt>ShapesEditorPaletteFactory#createComponentsGroup()</tt>)
issues a request to the EditPart (for example a <tt>CreateRequest</tt>) under the 
mouse pointer.
</li>
<li>
The EditPart might process the request directly or forward the request to
an EditPolicy. The request is processed  and if the preconditions are
met, it is answered by a command (for example a <tt>ShapeCreateCommand</tt>), otherwise
 <tt>null</tt> is returned (for an example see <tt>getCreateCommand(CreateRequest)
</tt> in <tt>DiagramEditPart.ShapesXYLayoutEditPolicy</tt>).
</li>
<li>
If the command can execute (depending on the return value of the <tt>canExecute()</tt> method),
the execute() method will be called, which is responsible for adding a new model element 
instance into the model. As you can observe in <tt>ShapeCreateCommand</tt>, in our case there is
no need to instantiate a new model element directly. This has already been done by the
Factory associated with selected tool (e.g. the <tt>CombinedTemplateSelectionEntry</tt>, 
see code snippet 1). Therefore we can just retrieve the new instance from the creation request and
put in into the model (see code snippet 2).
</li>
<li>When the Shape is added into the model (redo() method in snippet 2), a
CHILD_ADDED_PROP property change event is fired by the <tt>ShapesDiagram</tt> 
instance (<tt>parent</tt> field in snippet 2). This property change event, will cause
the DiagramEditPart to refresh its children (see 
<tt>DiagramEditPart#propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent)</tt>) and thus the new
shape will appear in the editor.
</ol>
<tt>
// snippet 1, taken from ShapesEditorPaletteFactory#createToolsGroup()<br>
CombinedTemplateCreationEntry component = new CombinedTemplateCreationEntry(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ellipse",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Create an elliptical shape",<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; EllipticalShape.class,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; new SimpleFactory(EllipticalShape.class),  // <-- responsible for creating a new instance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ImageDescriptor.createFromFile(ShapesPlugin.class, "icons/ellipse16.gif"),<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; ImageDescriptor.createFromFile(ShapesPlugin.class, "icons/ellipse24.gif"));
</tt>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<tt>
// snippet 2, taken from ShapeCreateCommand<br>
public void execute() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; newShape = (Shape) request.getNewObject();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; newShape.setSize(request.getSize()); // might be null!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; newShape.setLocation(request.getLocation());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; redo();<br>
}<br>
</tt>
<tt>
public void redo() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; childAdded = parent.addChild(newShape);<br>
}<br>
</tt>
